						<h1>SRAM Apex</h1>
					</header>
					<p>The SRAM Apex groupset is the entry-level groupset for SRAM. The Apex groupset however, does not feel like its entry level by any means. In fact its performance and weight is equivalent to the Shimano 105 groupset (mid-range for Shimano). The Apex groupset is a great choice for any cyclist who is ramping up their interest in riding, and gives riders a taste of SRAM's double-tap technology without the big price tag.</p>

				<article id="item-two">
					<header>
						<h1>SRAM Force</h1>
					</header>
					<p>The SRAM Force groupset offers a no-comprimise solution for high-level riders to have a great drive-train experience without breaking the bank. SRAM Force delivers a higher bar of performance over the Apex groupset, and is better suited for amateur racers than something like SRAM Apex.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article id="item-three">
					<header>
						<h1>SRAM Rival</h1>
					</header>
					<p>SRAM Rival components deliver incredible performance across a wide variety of Bikes and riding styles. The SRAM Rival groupset mixes aspects of the SRAM Force and SRAM Red component sets. Though it is a bit heavier and less responsive than the SRAM Red component set, SRAM Rival components are of top-notch quality and will deliver the performance nessisary for an semi-professional rider.

				<article id="item-four">
					<header>
						<h1>SRAM Red</h1>
					</header>
					<p>SRAM Red is the ultimate, no-compromise component set. These are the highest quality, lightest, most responsive components that are offered by SRAM and possibly on the market. They are near silent and ultra-aerodynamic. With these great components, comes a great price tag. SRAM Red components are likely to be some of the most expensive components on the market, and are suited best for professional athletes or very enthusiastic riders.
